// question: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-moves-to-seat-everyone/

class Solution {
    public int minMovesToSeat(int[] seats, int[] students) {
        Arrays.sort(seats);
        Arrays.sort(students);
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<seats.length;i++){
            res += Math.abs(seats[i]-students[i]);

        }
        return res;
    }
}


//explanation :

// 1. we need to sort both arrays.
// 2. by using a loop we will be finding the absolute difference between the elements
// of both arrays.
// 3. finally we are going to add the elements in res.
