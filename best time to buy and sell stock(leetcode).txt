The approach is as follows:

Iterate through each price
Keep track of the minimum price (this will be our "buy" price)
Keep track of the maximum profit (profit being the current price / "sell" price minus the minimum price / "buy" price)
Return the max profit
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        min_price = max(prices)
        
        for price in prices:
            if price < min_price:
                min_price = price
            
            if price - min_price > max_profit:
                max_profit = price - min_price
        
        return max_profit
